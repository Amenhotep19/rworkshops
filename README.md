# R Workshops

This repository is a clearing house for resources for individual R workshops from Research Computing Services.  Materials from a few past workshops that were in this repository are now in the `pastworkshops` directory.

# Workshops

Below are workshop materials from Northwestern IT Research Computing Services.  NOTE: Revisions to workshop materials and new exercises coming soon.  

[Intro to R](https://github.com/nuitrcs/intro_r_workshop): Materials for both abbreviated and multi-part introductory workshops can be found here.  Introductory workshops cover 

[`ggplot`](https://github.com/nuitrcs/ggplotworkshop): Workshop on how to use `ggplot`

[Databases](https://github.com/nuitrcs/databases_workshop/tree/master/r): Information on how to connect to databases from R is part of the databases workshop materials, which also cover the basics of SQL.  The example code there may be a useful reference, but you'll need a database connection to run it.  See that repository for more details.

# R Resources

## Reference Materials

[RStudio Cheat Sheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) are short pdfs that summarize key R functions on specific topics. Many people print them out for reference while working in R.  The `ggplot` cheat sheet, in particular, in indispensable.  

## Interactive Tutorials/Courses

[DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com): Excellent online courses teaching many aspects of R, Python, and SQL.  You write R code directly in your web browser as you work through each lesson.  DataCamp is aimed at training data scientists, but most of the courses and skills are applicable to academic researchers as well.  Some DataCamp courses assume familiarity with basic data analysis concepts, but many teach data analysis skills along with teaching R.  Northwestern Research Computing currently has a limited number of subscriptions available for students, faculty, and staff.  [More information](http://www.it.northwestern.edu/research/campus-events/data-camp.html).

[Swirl](http://swirlstats.com/): Swirl courses run interactively directly in R.  There courses teach both statistical concepts and R together.  See the Swirl website for instructions on installing and using the package. 

## Tutorials/Online Courses

[Data Analysis and Visualization using R](http://varianceexplained.org/RData/): an online course from David Robinson, whose [blog](http://varianceexplained.org/) is also worth following.

[OnePageR](https://togaware.com/onepager/): Series of tutorials and sometimes book chapters on using R for data science.  Emphasis here is on machine learning models, but there's lots of useful info for people using R for other purposes as well.

## Others' Workshops

Materials from other workshops.  These resources often include materials for both instructors and students.  They are often good resources if you're learning on your own as well though too.

[Harvard IQSS Workshops](http://dss.iq.harvard.edu/workshop-materials): Harvard's Institute for Quantitative Social Science, Data Science Services has their workshop materials online.

[Software Carpentry: R for Reproducible Scientific Analysis](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/): provides a good introduction to R. The materials are meant for teaching an in-person workshop, but you can work through them on your own as well.

[University of Cambridge](https://github.com/lgatto/TeachingMaterial): extensive set of workshops taught on a wide range of R topics.

[Berkeley D-lab R Fundamentals](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/R-Fundamentals): some of this material has been incorporated into our workshops too.

## Books

[R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) is a book available online. It is written by Hadley Wickham, who wrote many of the packages you use throughout the assignments in this workshop, and Garrett Grolemund, who also works at RStudio. It's a good resource to refer to after the workshop, but it may also be a useful reference as you work through the assignments here. It includes exercises for you to practice the skills you are learning.

[An Introduction to Statistical and Data Sciences via R](http://moderndive.com/index.html) by Chester Ismay and Albert Y. Kim: learn data science and statistics concepts along with R

The [Use R!](http://www.springer.com/series/6991?detailsPage=titles) series of books are available online through the Northwestern library. Search the [library catalog](http://search.library.northwestern.edu) for the title you're interested in, then follow the links in the search result to gain access to the online version of the book.  The series has a few titles about general skills, but many additional domain-specific titles.  Pay attention to the publication date, as occasionally information may be outdated (although usually still a good reference). 

## Videos

[RStudio Webinars](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/) cover a wide range of topics on using R and RStudio

## R for Users of Other Statistical Programs

If you're coming to R from Stata, SPSS, SAS, Matlab, or Python, the following resources might be useful to you. Some of them may be a little outdated, but each contains some tables of equivalent commands across programs that might help you get familiar with R more quickly.

[R/Stata Comparison](http://www.princeton.edu/~otorres/RStata.pdf) from Princeton's Data & Statistical Services

[R for SAS and SPSS Users](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4mP5kf41BrmYkxkdmdRdWFibDA/view) is an early, condensed version of a book by the same name, from Bob Muenchen of <a href="https://www.r4stats.com">r4stats.com</a>

[Matlab/R Reference](http://www.math.umaine.edu/~hiebeler/comp/matlabR.pdf): from David Hiebeler of the University of Maine.

[Matlab/NumPy (Python)/R Commands Chart](http://mathesaurus.sourceforge.net/matlab-python-xref.pdf): from Vidar Bronken Gundersen; this one is about 10 years old, but it mostly covers basic commands, which haven't changed

[haven Package](http://haven.tidyverse.org/): for importing Stata, SAS, and SPSS data into R.


## Statistics

Many of the resources above include statistical components.  In addition, the resources below have a particular focus on statistics.
