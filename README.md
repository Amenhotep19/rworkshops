# R Workshops

This repository is a clearing house for resources for individual R workshops from Research Computing Services.  Materials from a few past workshops that were in this repository have been removed.  See the Intro to R repository linked below instead for current versions of those materials.

# Workshops

[Intro to R](https://github.com/nuitrcs/intro_r_workshop)

[`ggplot`](https://github.com/nuitrcs/ggplotworkshop)

[Databases](https://github.com/nuitrcs/databases_workshop/tree/master/r): Information on how to connect to databases from R is part of the databases workshop materials, which also covers the basics of SQL.  The example code there may be a useful reference, but you'll need a database connection to run it.  See that repository for more details.  Note: R parts of databases workshop materials are still in the works; will be done by September 11th.


# Software

For workshops, it's best to install R and RStudio on your own laptop (both are free).

[Install R](https://cran.rstudio.com/)

[Install RStudio Desktop](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

There is [a video](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/working-with-the-rstudio-ide-part-1/orientation?ex=3) covering the process available from DataCamp.

If you do not have administrator privileges on your work computer, either work with the relevant IT department to get R and RStudio installed, or use a different laptop for the workshop.

If, for some reason you can't install R and RStudio, there are some web based options you could try for accessing R.  We are not endorsing these in anyway, just pointing out options that you could explore on your own if needed.  They may not allow you to do all of the things we do in the workshops.

# R Resources

## Reference Materials

[RStudio Cheat Sheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) are short pdfs that summarize key R functions on specific topics. Many people print them out for reference while working in R.  The `ggplot` cheat sheet, in particular, in indispensable.  

## Interactive Tutorials/Courses

[DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com): Excellent online courses teaching many aspects of R, Python, and SQL.  You write R code directly in your web browser as you work through each lesson.  DataCamp is aimed at training data scientists, but most of the courses and skills are applicable to academic researchers as well.  Some DataCamp courses assume familiarity with basic data analysis concepts, but many teach data analysis skills along with teaching R.  Northwestern Research Computing currently has a limited number of subscriptions available for students, faculty, and staff.  [More information](http://www.it.northwestern.edu/research/campus-events/data-camp.html).

[Swirl](http://swirlstats.com/): Swirl courses run interactively directly in R.  There courses teach both statistical concepts and R together.  See the Swirl website for instructions on installing and using the package. 

## Tutorials/Online Courses

[Data Analysis and Visualization using R](http://varianceexplained.org/RData/): an online course from David Robinson, whose [blog](http://varianceexplained.org/) is also worth following.

[OnePageR](https://togaware.com/onepager/): Series of tutorials and sometimes book chapters on using R for data science.  Emphasis here is on machine learning models, but there's lots of useful info for people using R for other purposes as well.

[UBC Stat 545: Data wrangling, exploration, and analysis with R](http://stat545.com/): includes exercises (homework) if you're looking to practice your skills more 

## Books

[R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) is a book available online. It is written by Hadley Wickham, who wrote many of the packages you use throughout the assignments in this workshop, and Garrett Grolemund, who also works at RStudio. I wouldn't start with this as a complete newbie, but after the intro R workshop, you should be ok to start with this.  It may also be a useful reference for beginners working on the intro R exercises. It includes exercises for you to practice the skills you are learning.

[An Introduction to Statistical and Data Sciences via R](http://moderndive.com/index.html) by Chester Ismay and Albert Y. Kim: learn data science and statistics concepts along with R

The [Use R!](http://www.springer.com/series/6991?detailsPage=titles) series of books are available online through the Northwestern library. Search the [library catalog](http://search.library.northwestern.edu) for the title you're interested in, then follow the links in the search result to gain access to the online version of the book.  The series has a few titles about general skills, but many additional domain-specific titles.  Pay attention to the publication date, as occasionally information may be outdated (although usually still a good reference). 

[Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/) by Hadley Wickham, for when you're ready to take the next step.  Much of the material here you won't need when just doing routine analysis with R, but it's essential material if you're trying to really understand how R works.

## Others' Workshops

Materials from other workshops.  These resources often include materials for both instructors and students.  They are often good resources if you're learning on your own as well though too.

[haven Package](http://haven.tidyverse.org/): for importing Stata, SAS, and SPSS data into R.


## Statistics

Many of the resources above include statistical components.  In addition, the resources below have a particular focus on statistics.

[UCLA's Statistics Consulting Group](http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/dae/) has a great set of tutorials showing how to conduct many types of ANOVA and regression analysis in various statistical packages, including R.  Highly recommended; check here first.

[Quick-R](http://www.statmethods.net/index.html) has many example snippets of R code covering statistical topics. Note that the visualization sections use the base R plotting functions and not `ggplot2`.

[Kelly Black's R Tutorial](http://www.cyclismo.org/tutorial/R/index.html) covers a few R basics, but then moves on to cover various statistical functions. Like the other resources above, it also uses base R plotting functions instead of `ggplot2`.

[Cookbook for R, Statistical Analysis section](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Statistical_analysis/) provides examples of many basic statistical methods.

[An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/ISLR%20First%20Printing.pdf) is a statistics book that uses R for examples and exercises. It's a standard text for many statistics programs.
